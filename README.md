# sql-challenge

In this repository you'll find my attempt at sketching an ERD, construction of tables, and then queries relating to the Module 9 challenge.

png of the ERD can be found in the Employee SQL folder
.sql file of my table schema (employeeTablesSchema) can be found in the Employee SQL folder
.sql file of my queries (employeeQueries) can also be found in the Employee SQL folder
All the csv I referenced / imported are also included in a further sub folder labeled 'data'

I did not have the opportunity to create a jupyter notebook to visualize all the query results, though I was just happy to have been able to successfully import the csv data into the relevant tables to do any querying / troubleshooting at all!
